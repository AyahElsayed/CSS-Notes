What Does A Pseudo-Element Do?
=============================

  It creates a phoney element and
  inserts it before or after the content of the element that you’ve targeted.

“pseudo” => means “lying, deceitful, false.”
they don’t actually change anything in the document.

pseudo-element content does not appear in the DOM. 
They allow us to add extra content, decoration and more to our pages 
without adding extra HTML, and they can be animated.

-----------

Note on “::” versus “:”:
It’s generally accepted that we use the double colon :: to denote pseudo-elements 
(as opposed to pseudo-classes like :hover, :first-child).

* Don’t forget “content”
This should make sure the element is visible on screen.
