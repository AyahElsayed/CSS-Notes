The box model
============

Block and inline boxes:
=====================

1- Block
  The box will break onto a new line.
  filling up 100% of the space available.
  The width and height properties are respected.
  Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box

2- inline
  The box will not break onto a new line
  Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
  Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.

-------------------

Parts of a box:
===============

  *Content box: 
      The area where your content is displayed, which can be sized using properties like width and height.
  *Padding box: 
      The padding sits around the content as white space
  *Border box:  
      The border box wraps the content and any padding.
  Margin box: 
      The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, 
      padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements.

----------------------------------------

The standard CSS box model:
==========================
Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the total size taken up by the box


The alternative CSS box model:
==============================
any width is the width of the visible box on the page, 
therefore the content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border.

By default => 
      browsers use the standard box model => 
      box-sizing: content-box;
turn on the alternative model => 
      box-sizing: border-box

------------------------

Margin
======
The margin is an invisible space around your box. 
It pushes other elements away from the box. 
Margins can have positive or negative values.


Margin collapsing:
==================
If you have two elements whose margins touch, and both margins are positive, 
those margins will combine to become one margin, which is the size of the largest individual margin. 
If one or both margins are negative, the amount of negative value will subtract from the total.

-------------------------------

Borders
========
The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. 
If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the box.

-------------------------------


Padding
=======
The padding sits between the border and the content area.
cannot have negative amounts of padding
Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding

--------------------

display: inline-block
=====================
    The width and height properties are respected.
    padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
